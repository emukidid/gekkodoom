# gekkodoom

A GameCube/Wii port of Doom using the [PrBoom engine](http://prboom.sourceforge.net/about.html) which uses SDL
Based on [WiiDoom] (http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiDoom)

## Planned changes
* Make invalid timidity configuration more obvious to the user (music works fine if this is setup properly)
* Working GameCube version
* Fix original WiiDoom port bugs
 1. Keycards/skullkeys are not shown in the HUD
 2. Some walls/textures are not drawn
 3. Weapon display in TNT is broken 
* Remove SDL and go direct to hardware where possible
